# 412Project
CMPUT412 Winter 2016 Final Project.

 The goal of this project was to create a differential drive robot that could be given task goals using an intuitive touchscreen interface and then complete the tasks autonomously using visual servoing. To complete this goal we designed a robot using Legoâ€™s EV3 bricks and created a touchscreen interface using a Android tablet. Visual servoing was accomplished using a Android phone as the camera, given 2DOF with pan and tilt motors. Additionally OpenCV for Android was used on the tablet for object detection. Furthermore Bluetooth was used for sending messages between the tablet and EV3. Finally we designed the robot to be able to go and grab a user selected ball and then take the ball to a user selected target and drop it.
